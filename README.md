Design process
I have observed that many females were not very confident about their bodies, and many different shops out there were only catered to a certain group of females. Hence i came up with the idea to design a website to suit all types of females, be it confident ones or not so confident ones.
Most females would definitely like to dress beautifully, but just can't seem to find the perfect piece that suits their body, hence in our website we cater pieces that suits all females out there.
We do not only provide our females with confidence wearing our clothes, but also through our website are they able to gain more confidence through our user interaction, where users get to read out motivational codes and pick a checkbox about how they feel about themselves
As Shermaine, i want to be able to wear beautiful dresses, so that i can be confident once again
As xalicia, i want to be inspirational like the motivational codes on the website, so that i can spread positivity to everyone
